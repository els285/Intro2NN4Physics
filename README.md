# Introduction to Machine Learning for Physicists

![image](./images/cover_banner.png)

Hello and welcome to the *Neural Network Building Blocks* repository for the 2025 Deep Learning School "Basic Concepts"!

## Session Goals
* Give context to the development of deep learning, and its importance in modern physical sciences.
* Build a foundation for deep learning by introducing classical ML techniques.
* Provide an introduction to the PyTorch ML framework.
* Explain the basis building blocks of deep neural networks, and their construction in PyTorch.
* Introduce canonical sueprvised learning tasks using the penguins dataset and ATLAS Experiment OpenData.

## Interactive Elements
1. Practice using `PyTorch` tensors
2. Simple linear regression
3. Binary classification through logistic regression
4. Applying neural networks to tasks 2 and 3
5. Building a small DNN to identify the Higgs boson in LHC data!
